# I am trying to resolve a customer issue as captured in PUBDEV-3454.  Dmitry Tolstonogov (ADP)
# said that he ran a GLRM model on a data set (which he has shared with us but would not want
# us to put it out to public) with many categorical leves (~13000 columns in Y matrix).  Model
# converges in ~1 hour for 76 iterations but job runs for another 6.5 hours while nothing happens.
#  Bar indicates 10% done.
#
# The following test is written to duplicate this scenario and captured the stalling.  Once we
# found the cause and fix it, this test will be used to test our results with a different dataset
# with similar characteristic.
